# This 3D World implementation allows you to control a camera using arrow keys moving around a landscape which includes trees, hills and roads. 
- The terrain is built as a mesh of triangles with vertices at each of the grid points with the corresponding altitude. The world is rendered using Phong Shading for lighting and uses vertex and fragment shader to support directional light.
- Avatar was created to mimic a Minecraft feel to the 3D World.
